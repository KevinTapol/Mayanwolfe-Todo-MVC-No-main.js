This is a full stack CRUD app that I commented out server.js of what was going to be abstracted and refactored to mvc.
What is unique about this is there is no main.js in public folders. 
For this reason, we had to use mongoose methods to take a POST in routes folder file edit.js and create a PUT method to update an object in the controllers folder file edit.js
